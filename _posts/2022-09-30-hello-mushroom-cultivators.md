# We're Here for Mushroom Cultivators

Growing mushrooms is a complex and time-consuming process. Each stage must be completed with care to ensure a quality outcome and avoid contamination. Top Left Mushroom Co is dedicated to making culitvation easier by eliminating big time-wasters in your grow flow. We are a team of experienced growers who know where the pain points are and how to relieve that pain.

# We'll Help You Save Time During Cultivation

Time is money! Our first product will save you hours of time prepping and pressure-cooking grain bags. Let us take care of all of that for you. We source the finest oats, prepare, sterilize, and package them for you. They'll be delivered right to your door, ready to inoculate with whatever mycelium you're trying to grow out. 

# We'd Love to Hear From You!

We're just getting started and are looking forward to finding more and better ways to help this community. We'd love to hear your ideas of what else we might offer to help make mushroom cultivation easier and more frictionless. Send us a DM on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/topleftmushroomco/); we're on there daily!
